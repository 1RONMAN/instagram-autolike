Instagram Autolike
==================

>> _Since you like my photos, you should **like** my photos!_

> _That makes sense. Hmm..._

Somebody I really care about observed that I always compliment her photos,
but my (unused, empty) Instagram profile does not reflect that in the amount of 'likes' I give her.

So, I decided that a bot would best express my likey feelings for these shots, without the need to open the app
on my phone.

You can botify your Instagram presence too an make someone smile, with these few lines of Python :) Ciao!
